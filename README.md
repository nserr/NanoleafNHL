# NHLNanoleaf
A program for Nanoleaf Aurora light panels to imitate a goal light when an NHL team scores, synced live with the game.

# Team Select
To change the default team (go Flames!) and support your favorite NHL team, simply replace the string in the variable team in main() with your team (full name).

# Lighting Effects
To change the lighting effects, replace the string in the variable teamEffect in main() with your Nanoleaf scene. To change the brightness it defaults to, replace the integer in the variable brightness in main() with your brightness.

# Setup
Use any Bonjour Browser and locate your Nanoleaf panels' IP address. Replace the current string in the variable ipAddress in the __name__ if-statement at the bottom of the code with yours. Hold the power button on the Nanoleaf panel controller for 5-7 seconds (until you see the light begin flashing), then run the program. It will get an authorization key for you and start. Now enjoy the game!
