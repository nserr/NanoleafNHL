# NHLNanoleaf
A format for Nanoleaf Aurora light panels to imitate a goal light when an NHL team scores, synced live with the game.

# Team Select
To change the default team (go Flames!) and support your favorite NHL team, simply replace the Team variable in main with your team.

# Light Effects
To change the lighting effects, replace the variable teamEffect in main with your desired Nanoleaf scene. To change the brightness it defaults to, replace the variable brightness in main with your desired brightness.

# Setup
Use any Bonjour Browser and locate your Nanoleaf panels' IP address. Replace the current IP with this one. Hold the power button on the panels controller for 5-7 seconds (until you see the light begin flashing), then run the program. It will get an authorization key for you and start. Now enjoy the game!
